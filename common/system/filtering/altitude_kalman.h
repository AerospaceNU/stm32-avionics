==== Introduction ====

A Kalman filter is a filter that can combine multiple sensor readings using the
math that describes the motion of a thing (it's dynamics). In our case, we know
the upwards acceleration of the rocket, and how that affects its position and
velocity. We can also directly measure it's position. We can write the following
equation, which would give us a new position and velocity given a known old
position, old velocity, and upwards acceleration:

new position = old position + velocity * time + 1/2 acceleration time^2
new velocity = old velocity + acceleration * time

In the ~modern controls nomenclature~, this means we have a "system" with two
"states" (position and velocity), one "input" (acceleration), and one "output"
(altitude). In this nomenclature, the input is what we put into the system
(thrust) and the output is what we can measure (barometric pressure ->
position). This also means we can estimate the values of states we can't
directly measure, like velocity!

Nomenclature:
- state: a thing that describes what our "system" is currently doing. For
example, our rocket's position and velocity.
- input: the thing(s) we can "put into" the system to make it do what we want.
For us, acceleration
- output: Something we can measure. For example, we can measure the altitude of
our rocket, but it's more difficult to measure its velocity
- x: a column vector describing the system's current state. One entry for each
state. for us, that's [[position], [velocity]]. It's dimensions are states x 1.
- x-hat: our state, but there's a hat to tell us it's just an estimate of our
true state
- u, the control input vector. For us, that's just [[acceleration]]. It's
dimensions are inputs x 1.
- y: output vector, with one element for each thing we can measure. For us,
[[position]]. It's dimensions are outputs x 1.
- System: A general term for the whole thing we're concerned with. In our case,
it's the rocket and its dynamics

==== Kalman Filters ====

In a Kalman filter there are two steps -- prediction and correction. In predict,
the estimate of where we are (x-hat) is updated based on the current inputs
we're giving our system. In ~state-space notation~, we can write it as one of
two forms, where _k denotes the current timestep and _k+1 the next one.

- Continuous-time, where x-dot (the time derivative of the state x) is given as
x-dot = Ax + Bu
- Discrete-time, where x_k+1 = A x_k + B u_k

A is a states x states matrix that describes how our system would evolve over
time without control input, and B is a states x inputs matrix that describes how
our system responds to a control input u. For controls people it's convienent to
write systems first in continuous-time form, but we don't have to. There's some
cool math that falls out of it too, but we don't actually care about that
either.

==== Prediction ====

In our Kalman filter, we use the discrete-time form in the predict step to
update our state estimate x with what's happened over the last 15-ish
milliseconds. We just have to keep running predict() forever to make sure our
estimate stays up to date!

Let's use the equations from way above to write it in matrix form. We combine
our position and velocity into one column vector for x:

x_k+1 = [new pos] = [old pos + vel * dt] + [1/2 acceleration dt^2]
        [new vel]   [old vel           ]   [acceleration * dt    ]

And factor out the constants:

x_k+1 = [new pos] = [1 dt] * [pos] + [1/2 dt^2] * [accel]
        [new vel]   [0  1]   [vel]   [dt      ]

==== Correction ===

The next bit of the Kalman filter is correction. The equation needed to get the
"output" vector of our system is given below, where y is a vector of each output
we can measure: y = Cx + Du

Where C relates the state x to the output y, and D relates the input u to the
output y. We said we could measure position, so:

y = [position] = [1, 0] * [pos] + [0] * [acceleration]
                          [vel]

The correct step of the Kalman filter takes this output, compares it to what we
thought our output should have been, and changes our state estimate a bit to
push us towards what we measured out output to be. How much we're "pushed" is
given by the kalman gain matrix, which has dimensions states x outputs.

New state estimate = old state estimate + (kalman gain) * (difference between
measured output and predicted output)

x_corrected = x-hat + kalman_gain * [y - (Cx + Du)]

x_corrected = [pos] + [k1] * [ [barometric altitude] - [1, 0] * [estimated pos]
] [vel]   [k2]                                      [estimated vel]

Let's analyze this in our case. It's saying if our measured altitude is above
the estimated one, we should increase our estimated position and velocity "a
bit"; the opposite holds true if we think we're too high. The discrete-time
kalman gain is unique for a given delta-time.

The kalman gain is computed by "balancing" how certain we are about each state
and each input to find an optional gain. One of the nice things about this
Kalman filter is that it's constant, so we can just compute it ahead of time. We
can change Q and R to change how much we "trust" our state estimate or our
measurements, respectively,, and Python can spit out a K that reflects those
ratios:

Q = [position state uncertainty^2, 0]
    [0, velocity state uncertainty^2]
R = [measurement uncertainty^2]

sysc = ct.ss(np.array([[0,1],[0,0]]), np.array([[0],[1]]), np.array([1,0]),
np.array([0])) sysd = sysc.sample(dt)  # Convert to discrete-time form described
above kalman_gain, P_steady = kalmd(sysd, Q, R).

If we want to trust the barometer less, easy! Just increase the corrosponding
entry in the R matrix and run it again to spit out a new kalman_gain matrix. We
know we have two states and one output, so our kalman_gain is a 2x1 matrix. For
example, if I set dt to 0.015 seconds, Q to diag([0.5, 1].^2) and R to
diag([10].^2) [numbers found by guess-and-check-what-works], the kalman_gain we
spit out is:

kalman_gain = [k1] = [0.166]
              [k2]   [0.091]

In summary: for each iteration of the filter:
(1) Predict() to project our state estimate x-hat forward one timestep. This
does the physics described above (2) Correct() with our barometer measurements
to incorperate our measurement of where we actually are
