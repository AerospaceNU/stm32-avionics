  An array container similar to the C++
  [[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/array/array/][std::array]], with
  some [[http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/][std::vector]]
  methods added. The maximum size is fixed as a template parameter, but
  the size is variable, like a vector. Values can be pushed and popped
  and the size adjusts accordingly. The data are stored internally as a
  statically allocated c style array. Care must be taken not to
  dereference an empty array or access elements beyond bounds.

  This library is very similar to
  [[https://github.com/janelia-arduino/Vector][Vector]], however Vector
  stores data externally, outside the container, and this library stores
  data internally. The pointer to the external memory causes the Vector
  container to use more memory than this container, but storing the data
  internally makes it necessary to use the maximum size as a class
  template parameter.

* Array vs Vector

** Array

   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
     const int ELEMENT_COUNT_MAX = 5;
     Array<int,ELEMENT_COUNT_MAX> array;
     array.push_back(77);
   #+END_SRC

** Vector

   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
     const int ELEMENT_COUNT_MAX = 5;
     int storage_array[ELEMENT_COUNT_MAX];
     Vector<int> vector(storage_array);
     vector.push_back(77);
   #+END_SRC
